#
# n: 
#       the slope of the linear portion of the concentration-effect curve

#
# age_specific_drug_concentration_sd: 
#       the actual drug concentration, per individual, will be drawn from a normal distribution with mean=1 and this sd.
#
# k: 
#       parameter that describes the change in the mutation probability when drug levels are intermediate

#       - set k=2 or k=4 for a piecewise-linear model where mutation probability increases from high concentrations
